== Description ==

Plugin for an easy setup of your TraveledMap. Get the list of your blog posts on a map.
TraveledMap is a website where you can create a map of your trips with details. This plugin allows you
to add the map of your trips on your WordPress site. Each trip is clickable to redirect to the link of your choice
(blog post linked to the trip, website, activity and so on).

**Important note**
The plugin is free but to embed the map on your website, I ask for from $4.99 to $19.99 by month depending on the number
of visits on your site.
